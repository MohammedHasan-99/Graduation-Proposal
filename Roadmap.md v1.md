## Project Roadmap v1

### Stage one: Gathering the necessary knowledge:

- Start learning the concepts of deep learning and computer vision.
- Search for a multi-face detection algorithm.
- Search for an appropriate image comparison algorithm.
- Be more familiar with Python and related libraries, e.g. openCV.
- Be more familiar with programming Desktop application using JavaFX.


### Stage two: Implementation:

- Separate the project into multiple modules.
- Implement the detection algorithm using a high-quality camera as input.
- Implement a simple database that contains students' images, names, and IDs.
- Apply the necessary image processing on the input sample.
- Implement an abstract comparison function that correctly compares two images and decides if they are matched.
- Implement a simple desktop application using Java and JavaFX.
- Export the comparison output as an Excel sheet.
- Combine the modules into an integrated program.Â 

### Stage three: Testing:


- Test each module separately.
- Test the whole system given an ideal data sample.

### Stage four: Maintenance and Optimization:
- Fix bugs occurred in the system
- Improve perfomance.

### Stage five: Future vision:

We will determine the recommendations at the end of the project.
