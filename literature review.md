### Deep Learning for Automatic Image Segmentation
the process of dividing an image into multiple segments. In this process, every pixel in the image is associated with an object type. There are two major types of image segmentation — semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.
In semantic segmentation, all objects of the same type are marked using one class label while in instance segmentation similar objects get their own separate labels.

### On the Security of Face Recognition Terminals at Modern Airports
The inability of airports to absorb the increasing numbers of passengers year after year, makes the use of egates and face recognition terminals a promising solution to enhance the quality of service and security. Thus, over the past few years, many airports around the world have adopted facial recognition technology to facilitate verification and identification of passengers, for example for surveillance systems, and recently for face recognition terminals. We believe that there are still many challenges and questions about face recognition in the context of these huge security applications, concerning performance, security and privacy.

### Face Recognition in Uncontrolled Environments, Experiments in an Airport

This paper presents and an evaluation of results obtained from a face recognition system in a real uncontrolled localization. The involved infrastructure is Barajas Airport (the international airport in Madrid, Spain). The use of this infrastructure during normal operation hours has imposed some constrains. It was not allowed to change or to add new cameras and passengers should not be disturbed by any means. Passengers should not be aware of the presence of the system, so no request should be done to change their normal behavior.

### Facial Recognition Based Attendance System
Traditional methods of automatic attendance systems like fingerprint, RFID or iris scans are easy to bypass, as the biometric features, such systems take into consideration are far less than facial features. Our facial recognition system is used to detect a person’s face and then compare it with the stored facial database to recognize it. Once the face is recognized, his attendance is marked, along with his in-time and out-time, and stored in a database. This paper proposes a system which uses Haar cascade method for facial detection integrated with principal component analysis (PCA) technology for facial recognition.

### College Student Attendance System Based on Face Recognition
In order to improve the efficiency of management and enhance the atmosphere of learning, in this paper, we develop a set of attendance system based on face recognition using the deep semi-NMF algorithm. Specifically, the system can automatically detect and recognize faces from the video images, and then gets its detailed information on attendance from the database. Moreover, the system not only performs simply, but also can be of great benefit to the whole educational field. The experimental results on real applications show that the system is effective and efficient.

### Attendance System with Face Recognition
For every organization, today attendance is the most important thing to record the presence of someone. The presence of someone in an organization is a sign that the person is carrying out their obligations to come to the agency or organization. Usually, attendance is done manually. It can be signed or called one by one. In this digital age, there AQ1 must be a change from this absence to be able to accelerate and provide time efficiency. We can use face recognition to record attendance from everyone present in an organization. In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone's face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person's face and record attendance from that person so that attendance activities are more efficient and faster.

### Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition
Attendance recording of a student in an academic organization plays a vital role in judging student’s performance. As manual labour involved in this process is time consuming, an automated Attendance Management System (AMS) based on face detection and face recognition techniques is proposed. A Face recognition system is an application of computer vision and image processing which is capable of performing two major tasks of identifying and verifying a person from an image or a video database. The main objective is to automate the attendance system by integrating the face recognition technology using modified Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI). Once face detection and feature extraction is performed by using viola jones and LBP, then the image is further moved for recognition. If the image is recognised then the attendance of student is marked as present in the data base, else it marked as absent.
