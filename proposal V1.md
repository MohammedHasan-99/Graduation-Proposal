## Introduction
based on the truth that a considerable number of students register others’ attendance, which become a common phenomenon. The efficiency of attendance check by manual record is not always satisfying, and it is really a headache to the whole educational field. 
Face Recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person’s face from image or video. Face recognition uses biometrics to map facial features from an image or video. Face recognition can help verify the personal identity from the face of a person. With these features of face recognition, we think face recognition can help people to verify attendance. In today’s digital age, face recognitionis very helpful in this area. Especially for educational areas that require attendance veriﬁcation. Maybe some parts are now relying on technology to verify attendance. But some still use traditional methods that take a long time. Thereforeface recognition is very helpful in terms of verifying attendance to speed up theprocess of recording and verifying the person.


## Problem Statment

Attendance recording of a student in an academic organization plays a vital role in judging a student’s performance. for a classroom in a university with around 80 students, manual labor involved in this process is time-consuming. Traditional methods of automatic attendance systems like a fingerprint, RFID, or IRIS scans are easy to bypass, as the biometric features, such systems take into consideration are far less than facial features. An automated Attendance Management System based on face detection and face recognition techniques is proposed.

In order to improve the efficiency of management and enhance the atmosphere of learning, in this project, we develop an attendance system based on face recognition and image processing. Our facial recognition system is used to detect a person’s face and then compare it with the stored facial database to recognize it. Once the face is recognized, his attendance is marked and stored in a database.


## Objectives

The main objective is to create an automated attendance system, which reduces the time consumed during the attendance process and prevents attendance Violations and Fraud. A system can easily help management to analyze students' attendance details.


## Project background

In the proposed system, initially, all the students will be enrolled by storing their facial images with a unique ID. At the time of attendance, real-time images will be captured and the faces in those images will be matched with the faces in the pretrained dataset. 
The best match results in displaying the name & roll number of that student. Attendance of the student is automatically updated in the excel sheet.


## Project Scope (Limitations)

- Initially in one classroom.
- There should be a PC with a local database of students' images in the classroom. 
- Number of students in the classroom is ## at max.   -based on the detection algorithm-
- High-resolution camera.
- Camera accesses a good and clear vision. 
- Students wearing masks will not be assigned as attended.
- No distinguishing between identical twins.
